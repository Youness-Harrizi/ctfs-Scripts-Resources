<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>32-BruteForce</h1><br/><p><h2>Theory</h2></p><p></p><p>Here you go—both screenshots merged into a single table you can copy/paste.</p><p><table class="table"><tr><th>Method</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th><th>Best Used When…</th></tr><tr><td>Simple Brute Force</td><td>Systematically tries all possible combinations of characters within a defined character set and length range.</td><td>Trying all combinations of lowercase letters from ‘a’ to ‘z’ for passwords of length 4 to 6.</td><td>No prior information about the password is available, and computational resources are abundant.</td></tr><tr><td>Dictionary Attack</td><td>Uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and passwords.</td><td>Trying passwords from a list like rockyou.txt against a login form.</td><td>The target will likely use a weak or easily guessable password based on common patterns.</td></tr><tr><td>Hybrid Attack</td><td>Combines elements of simple brute force and dictionary attacks, often appending or prepending characters to dictionary words.</td><td>Adding numbers or special characters to the end of words from a dictionary list.</td><td>The target might use a slightly modified version of a common password.</td></tr><tr><td>Credential Stuffing</td><td>Leverages leaked credentials from one service to attempt access to other services, assuming users reuse passwords.</td><td>Using a list of usernames and passwords leaked from a data breach to try logging into various online accounts.</td><td>A large set of leaked credentials is available, and the target is suspected of reusing passwords across multiple services.</td></tr><tr><td>Password Spraying</td><td>Attempts a small set of commonly used passwords against a large number of usernames.</td><td>Trying passwords like password123 or qwerty against all usernames in an organization.</td><td>Account lockout policies are in place, and you want to avoid detection by spreading attempts across multiple accounts.</td></tr><tr><td>Rainbow Table Attack</td><td>Uses pre-computed tables of password hashes to reverse hashes and recover plaintext passwords quickly.</td><td>Pre-computing hashes for all possible passwords of a certain length/character set, then comparing captured hashes against the table.</td><td>Many password hashes need to be cracked and you have storage for the rainbow tables.</td></tr><tr><td>Reverse Brute Force</td><td>Targets a single password against multiple usernames, often used with credential stuffing.</td><td>Using one leaked password to try logging into multiple accounts with different usernames.</td><td>There’s strong suspicion a particular password is reused across accounts.</td></tr><tr><td>Distributed Brute Force</td><td>Distributes the brute-forcing workload across multiple computers/devices to accelerate the process.</td><td>Using a cluster of machines to increase the number of combinations tried per second.</td><td>The target password/key is highly complex and a single machine isn’t powerful enough to crack it in reasonable time.</td></tr></table></p></div>
